Author: Audrey Morrisette
Requirements: PyQt4, Python 3
Description: Allows you to study a foreign language by providing the english word
             and asking you for the foreign language equivalent, or vice versa.


Very much a work in progress, but it works well enough at the moment if you want to
get studying :)
